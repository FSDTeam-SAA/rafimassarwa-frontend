                    <p className="text-sm text-[#4B4B4B] leading-[150%]">During the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call, Apple reported a record revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase from the previous year, with EPS reaching an all-time high of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. The company set all-time revenue records in several regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific, and observed strong momentum in emerging markets such as Latin America and South Asia. Services revenue achieved an all-time high of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year-over- year. Apple also highlighted its installed base reaching over 2.35 billion active devices. Product-wise, iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, Mac revenue rose by 16% to $9 billion, and iPad revenue increased by 15% to $8.1 billion. Despite a 2% year-over-year decline, wearables, home, and accessories revenue stood at $11.7 billion. The company maintained a robust gross margin of 46.9% and reported operating expenses of $15.4 billion. Looking ahead, Apple anticipates low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the March quarter, with services revenue expected to grow in low-double digits, despite facing foreign exchange headwinds.</p>
